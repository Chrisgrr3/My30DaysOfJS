# My 30 Days of JavaScript

I created this repository to keep track of my journey in relearning/remastering JavaScript. I was inspired to pursue this
in an effort to further my education and become a better software developer. All notes (in PDF documents) are in my own words, 
but drawn from Asabeneh's 30 Days of JavaScript challenge. Also coding questions are also drawn from his challenges, but the 
responses to those questions are entirely by me.
